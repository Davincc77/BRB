# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION
#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"
#
# IMPORTANT RULES:
# 1. NEVER REMOVE OR MODIFY EXISTING HISTORY - ONLY APPEND TO IT
# 2. ALWAYS MAINTAIN THE EXACT YAML FORMAT
# 3. ALWAYS UPDATE THE TEST SEQUENCE NUMBER WHEN TESTING IS COMPLETE
# 4. ALWAYS INCLUDE DETAILED COMMENTS IN STATUS HISTORY
# 5. ALWAYS COMMUNICATE CLEARLY BETWEEN AGENTS
#
# TESTING WORKFLOW:
# 1. Main agent implements a feature and marks it as implemented=true, working="NA"
# 2. Testing agent tests the feature and updates working=true/false with detailed comments
# 3. If working=false, main agent fixes the issue and sets needs_retesting=true
# 4. Testing agent retests and updates working status again
# 5. Repeat until all features are working=true
#
# STUCK TASK HANDLING:
# If a task has been attempted multiple times without success:
# 1. Increment stuck_count
# 2. Add to stuck_tasks list in test_plan
# 3. Consider using web search to find solutions
# 4. Provide detailed diagnostic information in status_history
#
# END OF PROTOCOL

The /api/check-burnable endpoint with is_contest: true parameter works correctly, returning 88% burn + 12% community pool allocation with allocation_type: 'contest' and appropriate note about contest allocation. Comparison between standard and contest allocations shows the expected differences: standard has normal allocations (burn, grok, community, team) while contest has simplified allocations (88% burn, 12% community only). However, the /api/execute-contest-burn endpoint fails with authentication errors even with admin token, returning status code 500 with error message 'Contest burn failed: Authentication failed., full error: {'ok': 0.0, 'errmsg': 'Authentication failed.', 'code': 18, 'codeName': 'AuthenticationFailed'}'. The transactions endpoint also fails with status code 500, preventing verification of database logging for contest burns. The issue is with MongoDB authentication - the MongoDB server is running without authentication, but the application is trying to connect with authentication credentials (admin:password). The MongoDB connection string in backend/.env needs to be updated to match the actual MongoDB configuration."
