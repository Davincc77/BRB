          comment: "Tab switching between Burn and Community tabs works correctly. Dark theme styling is consistent throughout the application. Responsive design works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile views. All UI elements render correctly with the silverish blue theme. The navigation is intuitive and user-friendly."

          comment: "Wallet connection/disconnection works properly with MetaMask, Coinbase, and Phantom options. Proper placeholder shown when wallet not connected.

          comment: "The Community tab UI is well-designed with proper allocation percentages and contest information is clearly presented. However, the /api/community/stats endpoint returns 500 error, causing console errors. This appears to be a backend issue rather than frontend integration problem. The UI still renders but without actual community data."

          comment: "The Community tab now loads correctly and displays all contest information. Community stats are visible showing the $DRB and $BNKR allocations. The contest token allocation section displays the simplified contest allocation with correct percentages (88% burn, 12% community pool). The backend API issues have been resolved."

The allocation display is visually appealing with proper icons and descriptions. The percentages add up to 100% correctly."

          comment: "Admin button is visible but login with provided credentials doesn't work, showing 'Invalid admin credentials' error. This may be due to environment configuration. The admin panel UI is well-designed based on code review, but couldn't be accessed for full testing."
