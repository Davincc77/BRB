Cross-Chain Enhancement Plan for Burn Relief Bot

CURRENT LIMITATION:
- Each chain operates independently
- $DRB and $cbBTC must exist on each chain
- No cross-chain bridging

FULL CROSS-CHAIN SOLUTION WOULD REQUIRE:

1. BRIDGE PROTOCOL INTEGRATION:
   - Wormhole (Multi-chain bridge)
   - LayerZero (Omnichain protocol)
   - Axelar (Cross-chain gateway)
   - Hyperlane (Modular interoperability)

2. CROSS-CHAIN DEX AGGREGATORS:
   - Li.Fi (Cross-chain bridge/DEX aggregator)
   - Socket Protocol (Meta-bridge aggregator)
   - Rango Exchange (Cross-chain DEX aggregator)
   - Via Protocol (Cross-chain routing)

3. ENHANCED TRANSACTION FLOW:
   Example: Burn USDC on Polygon → Get $DRB on Base
   
   a) Burn 88% USDC on Polygon
   b) Bridge remaining 12% USDC: Polygon → Base
   c) Swap bridged USDC to $DRB on Base
   d) Distribute $DRB according to allocation
   
4. COMPLEX ORCHESTRATION:
   - Multi-step transaction coordination
   - Cross-chain transaction monitoring
   - Failed bridge/swap recovery
   - Gas estimation across chains
   - Slippage management across bridges

5. USER EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES:
   - Multiple wallet confirmations
   - Longer completion times (bridges take 5-30 minutes)
   - Higher gas costs (bridge fees + swap fees)
   - Complex error handling

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLEXITY:
- High complexity (3-6 months development)
- Multiple protocol integrations
- Extensive testing across chains
- Security audits for cross-chain operations
